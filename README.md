Extended animation patch

1. Download 
2. unzip

## Idea
With basic `Animation` and `Loop Animation` Pathes you can't specify start and end delay of animation. 

### Idea is create one Patch for:

- Loop animation
- Animation with yo-yo effect (animation forward - then animate backward)
- specify start delay, duration and delay berween repeats
