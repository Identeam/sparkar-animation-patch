## Usage
1. Download 
2. unzip
3. Drag and drop the .arp file into you project

## Idea
With basic `Animation` and `Loop Animation` Pathes you can't specify start delay and delay between of animation. 

### Idea is create one Patch for:
- Animation
- Loop animation
- Animation with yo-yo effect (animation forward - then animate backward)
- specify start delay, duration and delay between repeats
